Once configured, install components from namespaced registries using:

```bash
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add @shadcnblocks/component-name --cwd apps/web

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @shadcnblocks/component-name --cwd apps/web

The CLI will automatically use the API key from the environment variable to authenticate with the registry.
